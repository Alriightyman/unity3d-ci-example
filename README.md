# unity3d gitlab-ci example

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/gableroux/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/gableroux/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/commits/master)

This project is a PoC to run unity3d tests and builds inside gitlab-ci using [gableroux/unity3d docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gableroux/unity3d/). It currently creates builds for Windows, Linux, MacOS and webgl. The webgl build gets published to [gitlab-pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/)!

## Points of interest

### gitlab-ci

This is probably what you're looking for, have a look to [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml)

### build script

File passed to the unity3d command line as argument to create builds

See [`BuildScript.cs`](Assets/Scripts/Editor/BuildCommand.cs)

### test files

Very basic `editmode` and `playmode` tests (all passing) can be found in [Assets/Scripts/Editor/EditModeTests](Assets/Scripts/Editor/EditModeTests) and [Assets/Scripts/Editor/PlayModeTests](Assets/Scripts/Editor/PlayModeTests)

### CI Pipelines and artifacts

See [project's pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gableroux/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/pipelines) which contains **built artifacts** ðŸŽ‰ .

## How to execute the tests

For current project, outside of docker, one can run the tests from command line as usual this way:

```bash
path/to/unity -runTests -projectPath $(pwd) -testResults $(pwd)/editmode-results.xml -testPlatform editmode
path/to/unity -runTests -projectPath $(pwd) -testResults $(pwd)/playmode-results.xml -testPlatform playmode
```

## How to activate

You'll first need to run this locally. All you need is [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone this project
2. Pull the docker image and run bash inside, passing unity username and password to env

    _hint: you should write this to a shell script and execute the shell script so you don't have your credentials stored in your bash history_. Also make sure you use your Unity3d _email address_ for `UNITY_USERNAME` env var.

    ```bash
    UNITY_VERSION=2018.2.3f1
    docker run -it --rm \
    -e "UNITY_USERNAME=username@example.com" \
    -e "UNITY_PASSWORD=example_password" \
    -e "TEST_PLATFORM=linux" \
    -e "WORKDIR=/root/project" \
    -v "$(pwd):/root/project" \
    gableroux/unity3d:$UNITY_VERSION \
    bash
    ```
3. In Unity docker container's bash, run once like this, it will try to activate

    ```bash
    xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args='-screen 0 640x480x24' \
    /opt/Unity/Editor/Unity \
    -logFile \
    -batchmode \
    -username "$UNITY_USERNAME" -password "$UNITY_PASSWORD"
    ```

4. Wait for output that looks like this:

    ```
    LICENSE SYSTEM [2017723 8:6:38] Posting <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><root><SystemInfo><IsoCode>en</IsoCode><UserName>[...]
    ```
    If you get the following error:
    
    > Can't activate unity: No sufficient permissions while processing request HTTP error code 401
    
    Make sure your credentials are valid. You may try to disable 2FA in your account and try again. Once done, you should enable 2FA again for security reasons. See [#11](https://gitlab.com/gableroux/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/issues/11) for more details.

5. Copy xml content and save as `unity3d.alf`
6. Open https://license.unity3d.com/manual and answer questions
7. Upload `unity3d.alf` for manual activation
8. Download `Unity_v2018.x.ulf`
9. Copy the content of `Unity_v2017.x.ulf` license file to your CI's environment variable `UNITY_LICENSE_CONTENT`.
   _Note: if you are doing this on windows, chances are the [line endings will be wrong as explained here](https://gitlab.com/gableroux/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/issues/5#note_95831816). Luckily for you, [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) solves this by removing `\r` character from the env variable so you'll be alright_
[`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) will then place the `UNITY_LICENSE_CONTENT` to the right place before running tests or creating the builds.

## How to add build targets

Update [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) by adding a build section like this:

```yaml
build-StandaloneWindows64:
  <<: *build
  variables:
    BUILD_TARGET: StandaloneWindows64
```

Supported build targets can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/BuildTarget.html)
